# Tic-Tac-Toe

In this Small project, I used SFML as 2D renderer, along with C++ to make Tic Tac Toe Game. 
The game provides:  
    - 2 players Mode: where two players can play against each other  
    - 1 Player Mode:    
        - Easy: Where the computer will select the case randomly.  
        - Medium: Where the computer will select the case by doing some searching and randomly.  
        - Hard: Where the computer uses MiniMax Algorithm through witch the computer will select the best case to either win or prevent the other player from winning.
